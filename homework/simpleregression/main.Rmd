Due date: 2016-11-18

From the dataset [cars](https://roualdes.us/data/cars.txt), predict the average price of a car using simple linear regression -- you choose an appropriate explanatory variable.  Full sentences and a knitted R markdown file are required.  Follow these steps for your analyses.

a. Introduction: describe the data, with words and statistics, and explain what you are interested in about these data.
b. Plot data: in one or two plots showcase the data and provide a plot meaningful to your analysis.
c. Analyze data: describe what type of analysis you have performed on these data, detailing anything pertinent about the set or the setup for your analysis.
d. Conclude: describe what results you have gleaned from the analysis.

Further, your analysis should include:

  a. A correlation calculation, and a corresponding bootstrapped confidence interval.
  b. An appropriate plot to display the data with respect to your analysis.
  c. A discussion of the appropriateness of simple linear regression's assumptions.
  d. Formal hypothesis tests or confidence intervals.
  e. A formal conclusion in both Statistics and in English.
  f. An interpretation of your model in context -- intercept, slope, adjusted $R^2$.
  g. The value your model predicts when the explanatory variable is equal to its mean and a sentence describing this value.
  h. The \texttt{R} code used to produce the analysis.
