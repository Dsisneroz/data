1. The airline company FlyMoar claims that of regularly scheduled flighs, departures and arrivals are on time $83$\% and $82$\% of the time, respectively.   The probability that a flight arrives and departs on time is $78$\%.
    a. What is the probability that one of FlyMoar's flights arrived on time given that it departed on time?
    b. What is the probability that one of FlyMoar's flights departed on time given that it arrived on time?

2. $70$\% of the light aircraft that disappear while in flight in a certain county are subsequently discovered.  Of the aircraft that are discovered, $60$\% have an emergency locator, whereas $10$% of the aircraft not discovered have such a locator.  Suppose a light aircraft disaapears while in flight.
    a. What is the probability that it has an emergency locator and it will not be discovered?
    b. What is the probability that it has an emergency locator?
    c. If it has an emergency locator, what is the probability that it will not be discovered?

3. Suppose a card is drawn from a standard deck of cards.  Let $A$ be the event that the card drawn is an eight, and $B$ be the event that the card drawn is an ace.  Are these two events independent?

4. Using R, simulate the probability of sampling a vowel from the alaphabet?  How close is your approximation?  How could you ensure your approximation is closer to the true answer?  Hint: ?letters, re: Lecture on Introduction to Probability, slide Probability, example
