Due date: 2017-05-01

Pick a dataset, that I haven't previously used, from my website, from an R package, or supply your own, run simple linear regression on it, and describe your analysis.  You need at least the following items in your write up:

1. A description of the data -- the variables, the origin of the data and the data set (such that I could find it and replicate your work).
2. An appropriate plot to display the data with respect to your analysis.
3. An interpretation in context of both the slope and the intercept.
4. An interpretation of adjusted $R^2$.
4. A formal hypothesis.
5. A formal conclusion in both Statistics and such that your Grandmother could understand.
6. The R code used to produce the analysis.
