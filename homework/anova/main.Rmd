Pick a dataset, that I haven't previously used, from my website or from an R package, run ANOVA on it, and describe your analysis.  You need at least the following items in your write up:

1. A description of the data -- the variables, the origin of the data and the data set (such that I could find it and replicate your work).
2. An appropriate plot to display the data with respect to your analysis.
3. A statement about the validity of ANOVA via its assumptions.
4. A formal hypothesis.
5. A formal conclusion in both Statistics and in English.
6. The R code used to produce the analysis.
