1. What is the expected value of the following random variable

x               1       2       3       4       5       6
--------        ----    ----    ----    ----    ----    ----
P(X = x)        0.5     0.15     0.15   0.05    0.1     0.05


2. Provide the *R* code to justify the 68, 95, 99.7 rule.

3. Suppose adult heights are distributed normally with a mean of 70 inches and a standard deviation of 4 inches.
   a. What is the probability we randomly select an adult who is between 64 and 78 inches tall?
   b. What is the probability a randomly selected adult is less than 67 inches tall?
   c. What is the probability a randomly selected adult is greater than 76 inches tall?
   d. Below what value are the shortest 8.25% of adults?

4. Assume $X \sim Exp(\lambda)$ is a continuous random variable.  Calculate the expected value of the random variable $X$.  Provide your work.
