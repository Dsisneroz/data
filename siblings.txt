Sibling pairs of salmon

Description:

    A random sample of 30 sibling pairs was taken to test the
    effectiveness of a hormone on the oxygen consumption of salmon.
    One sibling was randomly selected to receive the hormone and while
    the other sibling acted as a control.  Each salmon swam for 15
    minutes under the same conditions and the measure Scope was
    recorded.  Scope is defined as the difference between the maximum
    and minimum oxygen consumption during the 15 minute experiment on
    each salmon.

Usage:

    siblings <- read.csv("https://roualdes.us/data/siblings.csv")

Format:

    A data frame with 60 observations on the following 3 variables.

    'scope' A measure of oxygen consumption.

    'treatment' The treatment assigned to each fish.

    'siblingpair' Denotes which fish are siblings.
