## Suppose  X_i ~ Exp(lambda = 15), R in {100, 1000, 10000}, and n in {10, 50, 100}.  Do each of the following problems for each combination of R and n.

## 1. Generate randomly distributed Exponential data of size n.
## ?rexp

## 2. Plot the exponential data.

## 3. Calculate R sample means from the generated data.

## 4. If X ~ Exp(lambda), then E(X) = lambda and Var(X) = lambda^2.  Use this to standardize  means; calculate a z-score for each sample mean.

## 5. Plot the standardized sample means.

## 6. Describe the plot of standardized sample means, making reference to the Central Limit Theorem.

## 7. What would happen to the standard error of the sample mean if the sample size increases?  Why does this make sense intuitively?

## 8. The distribution of the number of eggs laid by a certain species of hen during their breeding period is 35 eggs with a standard deviation of 18.2. Suppose a group of researchers randomly samples 45 hens of this species, counts the number of eggs laid during their breeding period, and records the sample mean. They repeat this 1,000 times, and build a distribution of sample means.

## 8.a What is this distribution called?

## 8.b Would you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed? Explain your reasoning.

## 8.c Calculate the variability of this distribution and state the appropriate term used to refer to this value.

## 8.d Suppose the researchersâ€™ budget is reduced and they are only able to collect random samples of 10 hens. The sample mean of the number of eggs is recorded, and we repeat this 1,000 times, and build a new distribution of sample means. How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the original distribution?
