## Consider Darwin's finch data: https://roualdes.us/data/finches.csv.

## 1. Plot the tarsus length for finches on the islands Floreana and
## San Cristobal.

## Which type of analysis is appropriate for these data?

## Detail aspects of the data that one should consider before
## analyzing the difference of means by island.

## Calculate a 98% confidence interval for the difference in mean
## tarsus length for finches on the island Floreana as compared to San
## Cristobal.

## Interpret your confidence interval.

## Is there evidence that the mean tarsus length differs by island?

## Set up a hypothesis test from which the above confidence interval
## could conclude; give the null and alternative hypotheses and the
## appropriate level of significance.

## Conclude your hypothesis above using the confidence interval.

## Justify your conclusion with a p-value.

## 2. Plot the upper and lower beak lengths of these Galapagos
## finches.

## Which type of analysis is appropriate to compare upper and lower beak lengths?

## Detail aspects of the data that one should consider before
## analyzing the mean difference between upper and lower beak lengths.

## On average which beak length is larger for Galapagos finches, the
## upper or lower beak length (mm)?  Construct a 95% confidence
## interval to justify your claim.

## Interpret your confidence interval.

## Set up a hypothesis test from which the above confidence interval
## could conclude; give the null and alternative hypotheses and the
## appropriate level of significance.

## Conclude your hypothesis above using the confidence interval.

## Justify your conclusion with a p-value.
