## Lab Introduction to Stats and R

## 1. Read in our email dataset (creating a data frame).
## Hint: Some Linux machines don't immediately play nicely with
## https.  Instead download the dataset manually and use read.csv
## on the file path.
## Hint: ?read.csv

## 2. Using the email dataset, calculate each of the statistics
## discussed in class on variables of your choice.
## Hint: see class notes

## 3. Write a function that calculates the mean of a numerical
## variable from the dataset email by using a for loop.
## Hint: ?for, ?[

## Compare the computation time of your for function versus the
## computaiton time of mean() using the function system.time().
## Hint: ?system.time

## 4. Make at least one plot of each of the plot types discussed in
## class using the email dataset.  Describe, with full English
## sentences, each plot.
## Hint: see class notes.

## 5. Make a list (map/dict) containing at least four different types
## of R objects (e.g. boolean, numeric, string, vector, list, data
## frame, matrix) where the key is the name of the value being held.
## Hints: ?list, ?vector, ?matrix, ?data.frame

## 6. What is the difference between these two methods of list
## extraction, [ and [[?
## Hint: ?[[

## 7. Create a vector of length > 1.  Write a function that uses a for
## loop to add 1 to each element.
## Hint: ?c, ?rep

## 8. With your original vector from 7., naively add one to the entire
## vector.  Compare the computation time of these two approaches.
