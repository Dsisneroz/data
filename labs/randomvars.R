## 1. Consider the following discrete random variable, X.
## x            | 6     7       8       9       10      11      12
## P(X = x)     | 0.1   0.2     0.3     0.2     0.1     0.05     0.05

## 1.a.
## Calculate the expected value and variance; efficiency counts.

## 1.b.
## Randomly sample from the random variable X,
## with samples sizes n = \{10, 100, 1000\}.
## Hint: ?sample

## 1.c.
## Calculate the sample mean and sample variance for each random
## sample/size combination.
## Comment on the relative correctness of your three guesses.

## 2. Assume the length of adult male Calponia harrisonfordis is
## normally distributed with mean 18.14 mm and
## standard deviation 1.76 mm. Hint: ?pnorm

## 2.a.
## What is the probability we would find a C. harrisonfordi that is
## shorter than 14.66 mm or longer than 21.66 mm?

## 2.b.
## What is the length of the longest 7.5% of C. harrisonfordis?

## 3. Randomly generate 1001 observations from a normal
## distribution of your choice (pick mean and standard deviation).
## Make a histogram from these observations. Hint: ?rnorm

## 4. Randomly generate 1001 observations from a Bernoulli
## distribution and estimate the variance using only the sample mean.
## Hint: ?rbinom, size=1 and you pick `prob`.

## 5. An airline charges the following baggage fees: $25 for the first
## bag and $35 for the second. Suppose 54% of passengers have no
## checked luggage, 34% have one piece of checked luggage and 12% have
## two pieces. We suppose a negligible portion of people check more
## than two bags.

## 5.a.
## What is the probability mass function for baggage fees?

## 5.b.
## Compute the average revenue per passenger, and compute the
## corresponding variance.

## 5.c.
## About how much revenue should the airline expect for a flight of
## 120 passengers? With what variance?

## 5.d.
##The current exchange rate for one U.S. dollar ($) to one Euro is
## .9355.  What is the expected revenue and variance in Euros?
