## Consider Darwin's finch data https://roualdes.us/data/finches.csv

## Choose two numerical variables of interest, pick one to be the
## explanatory, and plot the data.

## Fit simple linear regression using lm().

## Set up and conclude hypothesis tests for the slope and the intercept.

## Calculate approriately matching confidence intervals.  Do your
## confidence intervals agree with your hypothesis tests above?

## Fit simple linear regression using optim().  Your estimates of the
## slope and the intercept should match your work above.

## Interpret the slope and intercept in context.

## Bootstrap the standard errors of regression model using optim(),
## using boot(..., method="bca").  Ensure your estimated standard
## errors are close to the results of lm().

## Make bootstrap confidence intervals of your estimated
## coefficients. Note, these confidence intervals should be relatively
## close, but not exact to your work above.

## Interpret your confidence intervals in context.
