## Researchers interested in lead exposure due to car exhaust sampled
## the blood of 52 police officers subjected to constant inhalation of
## automobile exhaust fumes while working traffic enforcement in a
## primarily urban environment.  The blood samples of these officers
## had an mean lead concentration of 124.32 μg/l and a standard
## deviation of 37.74 μg/l; a previous study of individuals from a
## nearby suburb, with no history of exposure, found an average blood
## level concentration of 135 μg/l.  Use alpha = 0.05.


## 1.  Write down (type) the hypotheses that would be appropriate for
## testing if the police officers appear to have been exposed to a
## different concentration of lead.


## 2. Test the hypothesis that the downtown police officers have a
## different lead exposure than the group in the previous study.
## Interpret your results in context.


## 3. Calculate and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the mean
## lead concentration in the blood of police officers subjected to
## constant inhalation of automobile exhaust fumes.


## 4. Based on your preceding result, without performing a
## calculation, would a 90% confidence interval for the average blood
## concentration level of police officers contain 135 μg/l?


## 5. Based on your preceding result, now doing the calculations, does
## a 90% confidence interval for the mean blood concentration level of
## police officers contain 135 μg/l?  Interpret this confidence
## interval in the specified context.


## 6. Pretend the sample size increased, but the confidence is still
## 90% and all else stays the same, how will the confidence interval
## change?  Explain in words and then justify your claim with R code.
## interval change?  Explain in words and then justify your claim with
## R code.
