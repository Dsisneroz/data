## Consider our beloved email dataset:
## https://roualdes.us/data/email.csv
## Make a plot of the variable line_breaks by the levels of format and
## describe the plot.

## Calculate a 98% confidence interval of the sample mean of
## line_breaks.  Interpret your conifedence interval in context.

## Calculate a 98% bootstraped confidence interval of the sample mean
## of line_breaks.  Is your confidence interval the same?  Does it
## have the same interpretion?
## Use type "bca", unless your computer fans start to freak out.
## Then try "perc".

## Calculate a 98% bootstraped confidence interval of the sample
## median of line_breaks.  Interpret your conifedence interval in
## context.
## Use type "bca", unless your computer fans start to freak out.
## Then try "perc".

## Calculate a 95% confidence interval of the difference of sample
## means of number of line breaks by format -- two sample t-test.
## Interpret your confidence interval in context.

## Calculate a 95% bootstraped confidence interval of the difference
## of sample means of number of line breaks by format -- bootstrap
## equivalent two sample t-test.  Interpret your confidence interval
## in context.

## Calculate a 95% bootstraped confidence interval of the difference
## of sample medians of number of line breaks by format -- bootstrap
## equivalent of two sample test of medians.  Interpret your
## confidence interval in context.

## Why do we have to use the bootstrap in this scenario?
