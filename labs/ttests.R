## Consider Darwin's finch data: https://roualdes.us/data/finches.csv.
## Make a plot of the finches tarsus length (mm).  Detail aspects of
## the data that one should consider before analyzing the mean tarsus
## length.  Does anything concern you about these data?

## Calculate a 98% confidence interval for the difference in mean
## tarsus length for finches on the island Floreana as compared to San
## Cristobal.

## Is there evidence that the mean tarsus length differs by island?

## Set up a hypothesis test from which the above confidence interval
## could conclude; give the null and alternative hypotheses and the
## appropriate level of significance.

## How would you conclude a hypothesis test about the difference in
## mean tarsus length between these two island's finches?

## Plot the upper and lower beak lengths of these Galapagos finches.
## Detail aspects of the data that one should consider before
## analyzing the mean difference between upper and lower beak lengths.

## On average which beak length is larger for Galapagos finches, the
## upper or lower beak length (mm)?  Construct a 95% confidence
## interval to justify your claim.

## Interpret your confidence interval.

## Set up an appropriately matching hypothesis test to test the mean
## difference in upper to lower beak length, and use your confidence
## interval from above to draw a conclusion.
