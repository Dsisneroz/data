## Researchers interested in lead exposure due to car exhaust sampled
## the blood of 52 police officers subjected to constant inhalation of
## automobile exhaust fumes while working traffic enforcement in a
## primarily urban environment.  The blood samples of these officers
## had an mean lead concentration of 124.32 μg/l and a standard
## deviation of 37.74 μg/l; a previous study of individuals from a
## nearby suburb, with no history of exposure, found an average blood
## level concentration of 135 μg/l.  Use alpha = 0.05.


## 1.  Write down (type) the hypotheses that would be appropriate for
## testing if the police officers appear to have been exposed to a
## different concentration of lead.


## 2. Test the hypothesis that the downtown police officers have a
## different lead exposure than the group in the previous study.
## Interpret your results in context.


## 3. Calculate and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the mean
## lead concentration in the blood of police officers subjected to
## constant inhalation of automobile exhaust fumes.


## 4. Based on your preceding result, without performing a
## calculation, would a 90% confidence interval for the average blood
## concentration level of police officers contain 135 μg/l?


## 5. Based on your preceding result, now doing the calculations, does
## a 90% confidence interval for the mean blood concentration level of
## police officers contain 135 μg/l?  Interpret this confidence
## interval in the specified context.


## 6. Pretend the sample size increased, but the confidence is still
## 90% and all else stays the same, how will the confidence interval
## change?  Explain in words and then justify your claim with R code.


## 7. Check out the dataset mtcars.
?mtcars


## 8. Using the dataset mtcars, calculate a 99% confidence interval for a numerical variable of your choice grouped by a categorical variable of your choice.


## 9. Interpret your confidence interval.


## 10.  Identify the conditions under which your confidence interval will match a hypothesis test.


## 11. Name one value for which an appropriate hypothesis test would agree with your confidence interval and one value for which an appropriate hypothesis test would disagree with your confidence interval, e.g. name two values that would be specified in the null hypothesis.
