## Consider our beloved dataset ape::carnivora:
library(ape)
data(carnivora)

## Make a plot of the variable LY, longevity, and describe the plot.

## Calculate a 98% confidence interval of the sample mean of
## LY, longevity.  Interpret your conifedence interval in context.

## Calculate a 98% bootstraped confidence interval of the sample mean
## of longevity.  Is your confidence interval the same?  Does it
## have the same interpretion?
## Use type "bca".

## Calculate a 98% bootstraped confidence interval of the sample
## median of longevity.  Interpret your conifedence interval in
## context.
## Use type "bca".

## Can we bootstrap ANOVA, in the case that the normality assumption
## doesn't hold?
