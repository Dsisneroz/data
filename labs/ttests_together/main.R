## Consider a dataset on mammalian sleep patterns: ggplot2::msleep.
## library(ggplot2)
## ?msleep

## Plot sleep_rem by vore.


## Which type of analysis is appropriate for subsets of these data?  Which subsets?


## Detail aspects of the data that one should consider before
## analyzing the difference of means by (subsets of) vore.


## Calculate a 97% confidence interval for the difference in mean
## rem sleep for mammals by the subset of food preferences you chose
## above.


## Interpret your confidence interval.


## Is there evidence that the mean rem sleep differs by diet?


## Set up a hypothesis test from which the above confidence interval
## could conclude; give the null and alternative hypotheses and the
## appropriate level of significance.


## Conclude your hypothesis above using the confidence interval.


## Justify your conclusion with a p-value.
