Download and read the mnist dataset

Description:

     This function downloads the mnist training and test data from
     http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Usage:

    read.csv("")

Value:

     A list with two components: train and test. Each of these is a
     list with two components: images and labels. The images component
     is a matrix with each column representing one of the 28*28 = 784
     pixels. The values are integers between 0 and 255 representing
     grey scale.  The labels components is a vector representing the
     digit shown in the image.

     Note that the data is over 200MB, so the download may take several
     seconds depending on internet speed.

Examples:

    mnist <- read.csv("")
     # this can take several seconds, depending on internet speed.
     ## Not run: R code

     mnist <- read_mnist()
     i <- 5
     image(1:28, 1:28, matrix(mnist$test$images[i,], nrow=28)[ , 28:1],
         col = gray(seq(0, 1, 0.05)), xlab = "", ylab="")
     ## the labels for this image is:
     mnist$test$labels[i]
     ## End(Not run)
