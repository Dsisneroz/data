Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration over 800,000 years

Description:

     Concentration of carbon dioxide in ppm by volume from direct
     measurements at Mauna Loa (1959-2018 CE) and indirect measurements
     from a series of Antarctic ice cores (approx. -800,000-2001 CE).

Usage:

    read.csv("")

Format:

     An object of class ‘"data.frame"’.

Details:

        • year. Year (CE).

        • co2. Carbon dioxide concentration in ppm by volume.

        • source. Source of carbon dioxide measurement: direct CO2
          annual mean concentrations from Mauna Loa (`Mauna Loa`) or
          indirect CO2 concentrations from air trapped in ice cores
          (`Ice Cores`).

Source:

     Mauna Loa data from NOAA. Ice core data from Bereiter et al. 2015
     via NOAA.
