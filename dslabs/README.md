This is a modified version of the R package [dslabs found on
CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dslabs/).  These
modifications simply provide CSVs and help files of some of the
datasets, so that I may use the datasets in my courses where R is not
necessarily available.

This is my best attempt at following the section of the LICENSE titled
Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source.
