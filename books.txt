Textbook data for UCLA Bookstore and Amazon

Description:

     A random sample was taken of nearly 10% of UCLA courses. The most
     expensive textbook for each course was identified, and its new
     price at the UCLA Bookstore and on Amazon.com were recorded.

Usage:

     data(textbooks)
     
Format:

     A data frame with 73 observations on the following 7 variables.

     ‘deptAbbr’ Course department (abbreviated).

     ‘course’ Course number.

     ‘ibsn’ Book ISBN.

     ‘uclaNew’ New price at the UCLA Bookstore.

     ‘amazNew’ New price on Amazon.com.

     ‘more’ Whether additional books were required for the course (‘Y’
          means "yes, additional books were required").

     ‘diff’ The UCLA Bookstore price minus the Amazon.com price for
          each book.

Details:

     The sample represents only courses where textbooks were listed
     online through UCLA Bookstore's website. The most expensive
     textbook was selected based on the UCLA Bookstore price, which may
     insert bias into the data; for this reason, it may be beneficial
     to analyze only the data where ‘more’ is ‘"N"’.
